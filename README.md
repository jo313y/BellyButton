# BellyButton

## Overview

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Even Broader
The point of the project was to use html to pull in javascript data and use that data from a .json format to build graphs. It was then projected to an http server. After this, it was then stylized using css and html.
